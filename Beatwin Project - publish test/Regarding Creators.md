Creators are sacred beings who can create 1 out of the sea of nothingness.
They can give birth to 1 from 0, give birth to the endless, and then return it to 0 again in a flash.
They are freed from all restrictions, and Voyagers sometimes even call them gods.

In that sense, perhaps the [[Witch of Origins]], [[MARIA]], is a chosen girl, fated to become a Creator……

All [[Regarding Voyagers|Voyagers]] fear that the destination of their own journeys is becoming a Creator.
As to why they would fear advancing to the status of a higher-order being, only they themselves can comprehend the answer.
