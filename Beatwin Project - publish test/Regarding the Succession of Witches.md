In the noble families of witches, family secrets are often inherited by a single child to prevent a propagation of hidden arts and a subsequent decline in their quality.

This rule applies for the [[Endless Witch|Endless witches]], so their most secret arts are passed down to a single pupil, and once one has passed down these arts to another, they retire to further stem their propagation.

Custom dictates that a witch from another sect make a recommendation before a succession may occur.

[[Lambdadelta]] recommended [[EVA|EVA Beatrice]]. Bernkastel recommended [[ANGE|Ange Ushiromiya]]. It is unknown who recommended [[Beatrice|Beato]].

Furthermore, during the story, Beatrice inherited that name along with the position, but that is a very recent innovation. The Predecessor was the original Beatrice, and all [[Endless Witch]]es before her had different names. After that, it became customary for the name to be inherited as well, and EVA followed that tradition when giving ANGE the name of Beatrice.



### Theories

> The two titles of Beatrice (endless and golden) might be passed down through different unrelated means.

> **Evidence:**
> During the coronation of Evato, Beatrice confirms she is inheriting both titles:

> But while according to Maria's diary the main criterion for coronating a golden witch seems to be solving the epitaph, the sequence of endless witches seems to be a lot older, pre-dating Virgilia by at least a few generations.
