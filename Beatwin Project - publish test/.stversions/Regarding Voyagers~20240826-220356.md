Worlds of different fates and circumstances are called Fragments, and witches capable of crossing the ocean of endless Fragments are called Voyagers.
It is also a title used to indicate a high-order witch, and witches limited to their own territories cannot compare to their power.

However, perhaps because they don’t have well-defined territories of their own, their values are ever-changing, and it’s easy for their souls to become vague and insubstantial.
It isn’t uncommon for this to result in them turning into scraps of seaweed in the Fragment ocean and fading away.

Their voyage has no destination, and you might even say they’re on a journey to escape a destination.

Witches of an even higher order than Voyagers are called Creators.
