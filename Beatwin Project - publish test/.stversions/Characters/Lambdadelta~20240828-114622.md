# Descriptions

## Turn
### Tea party
#### 1
The [[Witch of Certainty]], who has lived for a thousand years.  
She embodies the idea that “hard workers are rewarded” and is revered even by humans.  

Though she is a witch, she does not stray far from the concepts of humans. For that reason, her power as one worshiped by humans is incalculable.  

However, she is fickle about whose efforts she chooses to reward, and in many cases, she bestows her favor upon those who entertain her the most.  

Her immense, swift, and terrifying power can make any witch surrender in an instant.  

However, she is often reckless, and [[Bernkastel]] was able to take full advantage of that.
