Servant Genji

# Descriptions


## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
The leader of the servants who work for the Ushiromiya family.

He has served [[Kinzo]] longer than any other and is the person most trusted by that old man.

Since he serves Kinzo directly, [[Krauss]] and [[Natsuhi]] think of him as being a spy for Kinzo.
#### 2
Found in the [[parlor]]. He had a weapon resembling an [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|icepick]] sticking out of his stomach, and his face had been smashed.

At the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.

#### 2
Missing.  

Selfless furniture seeks nothing but repose in the [[Golden Land]].  
However, since a fool obstinately rejects the Golden Land, it seems his time of repose is unlikely to come soon.  

Afterwards, he was torn to pieces and eaten by demons and went to hell.
### Tea Party
#### 1
Kinzo’s earliest furniture, which he created to serve him and him alone with complete loyalty.  

Though he was Kinzo’s first creation, he was made with the help of a high-class demon, so while there were several defects in his initial specifications, he conceals a great potential within himself.  

In the many years following that, he continued to mature and compensate for his many deficiencies, turning himself into the nearly flawless butler furniture that he is now.  

He is approaching the limit of his service life, but the magical power he can unleash for an instant rivals Kinzo’s.

#### 2
His body was found in the [[VIP room]] on the second floor.  

The weapon used on him is assumed to be a [[gun or spear-shaped object]].  

To thank Genji for his many years of service, let us allow him to rest in the VIP room.

His corpse was found in the dining hall.  
About half of his head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that he was murdered with a powerful gun or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don't believe he was killed with a gun...
