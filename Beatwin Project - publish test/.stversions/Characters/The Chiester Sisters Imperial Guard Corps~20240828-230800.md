Chiester 45
Chiester 410
Chiester 00
Chiester 556

An Imperial Guard Corps formed by the Dragon King Pendragon in memory of the flight of the red dragon and composed only of sisters.

They are technically subordinates of the Dragon King, but because of a long relationship with successive generations of [[Beatrice|Beatrices]], it was permitted that two Imperial Guard soldiers be lent out.

The sisters are simulated lifeforms created by magic.
For that reason, further sisters with a great variety of personalities are continually being created even now.

A great cost must be paid to manifest them in the human world, so summoning them can be quite a tricky prospect, even considering the tremendous fighting power they offer.

For that reason, they are often summoned as honor guards to serve during special ceremonies and the like.

# Descriptions
## Banquet
### Tea Party
#### Chiester 45
A weapon in a contract with [[Beatrice]].

45 has a methodical and timid personality, as well as a fairly strong persecution complex.
Thanks to that, she's well suited to shoring up the weaknesses of 410's rough personality when they work as a pair.

She can't stand silence, so she'll often become emotionally insecure if she isn't being ordered around by someone constantly.

45 excels in search and decision-making capabilities. The support she provides doubles the combative force of the sisters
#### Chiester 410
A weapon in a contract with [[Beatrice]].

410 is a kid with a strong personality, whose peculiar style of speech tends to make light of people.
She likes laughing at people who are serious or can never relax, which is why she's so fond of 45 and [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|Lucifer]].

Her choice of words may be coarse, but she loves company and gets lonely easily.
She gets depressed if there isn't someone talking with her constantly.

410 is particularly skilled when it comes to firing control, and she can wield unparalleled combative force even in close-range fighting.
## Alliance
### Tea Party
#### Chiester 00
A weapon of the Sisterâ€™s Cavalry, which serves Pendragon.

00 is their calm and composed leader. However, this is merely the role demanded of her, since she's far more frail by nature.

00 excels at reconnaissance and serving as an advance guard, displaying extreme supremacy in unexpected encounters.

However, her excessively powerful fighting strength has been called inhumane, and it isn't rare for her to be lynched and abused when she surrenders on the battlefield.

Her one eye silently speaks to that.

#### Chiester 556
##### 1
A quiet girl who's aaalways teased by everybody. But that's because everyone loves her.

The trumpet is her specialty. Everyone skips to her lively tune.
##### 2
A weapon of the Sisters' Cavalry, which serves Pendragon.

556 was quiet and often teased, but she was loved by everyone. However, her luck was always bad, and she met a tragic end in battle against the [[black witch]].

She was a cutting-edge weapon, unique in the Sisters' Calvary, which tended to serve as honor guards.

556 was in charge of squad fire support. She shot not to kill, but to protect her allies.
