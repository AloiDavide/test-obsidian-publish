# Descriptions


## Banquet
### Tea Party
#### 1
One of the 72 Great Demons. Works for a Master in exchange for various forms of compensation. He currently has a contract with [[Beatrice]] as her butler (head furniture).

He's become proficient at housekeeping after serving in many households, so his ability as a butler is very high.

In the high society of witches, employing him has become a kind of status symbol. Furthermore, the cookies he bakes are superb, and witches will often form a line demanding them.

He must possess tremendous magical power, but since he always stays out of the spotlight to further boost his Master's reputation, his combat capabilities are unknown.
