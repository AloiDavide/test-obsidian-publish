# Descriptions

## Banquet
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
The daughter of [[Rudolf]] and [[Kyrie]]. [[Battler]]'s younger sister from a different mother.  

She hasn't come in contact with Battler often, but is extremely fond and respectful of him.  

She was sick and absent during the family conference, so she always ends up surviving in solitude.  

A very unfortunate girl whose heart is in tatters.  

Has a bad habit of always walking around with massive amounts of cash, throwing it out to whoever comes first.
### Tea Party
The final witch, born in 1998.
She was named by [[EVA]] as her successor and was accepted, with [[Bernkastel]] as her guardian.

She had to start from square one as a witch, but because she exists 12 years in the future, she possesses the ultimate sort of magical resistance, for none of [[Beatrice]]'s magic can target her.

Furthermore, in a manner opposite to her brother's magical resistance, she has a natural talent for attacks against anything of a magical nature.
She holds tremendous potential for both offense and defense. However, the distance is vast. 12 years is a long time.
## Alliance
### 1998
#### 1
Even after throwing herself off the top of a skyscraper, she miraculously survived unharmed.
After that mystical experience, she threw away everything and went on a journey by herself to learn her past.

Can she break through [[Beatrice]]’s magic from her position 12 years in the future…?
### Tea Party
#### 1
The Endless Witch, who will live for one thousand years in the future. Or perhaps she's a hunter of witches, who will fell them all.

Witches cannot be felled if they are not understood. Witches cannot be felled even if they are understood.

To understand witches, and yet deny them. Only this contradictory power gives her the blade with which to fell witches.
