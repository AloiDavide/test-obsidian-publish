# Descriptions

## Alliance
### 1998
#### 1
Daughter of the declining noble family, [[Sumadera]].
[[Kyrie|Ushiromiya Kyrie]]’s younger sister.

She despises her sister, and by extension, [[Ange]]e as well.

She’s the opposite of the freewheeling person Kyrie once was and holds appearance in high regard, possessing a strong ambition for philanthropy. However, this is all just a craving for the limelight caused by the complex she has towards her sister.

There are several opposing factions in the Sumadera Family, and they’re constantly engaged in a secret feud over who will control the vast wealth Ange holds.
