# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
The aged head of the [[Ushiromiya]] family.

Even though it has already been announced that he has just a few months to live, he is brimming with energy. Though he amassed a vast fortune in the past, he never made any announcements regarding the inheritance, which worries his children.

He is strongly influenced by the West and is a rabid fan of the occult.
His study is packed with mysterious grimoires.
#### 2
Disappeared from his [[study]] unnoticed.
Kinzo’s study has everything from a bed to a toilet to a bathtub, so it is extremely rare for him to go outside.

However, he does occasionally go out for a walk on a whim without telling anybody, and his disappearance invariably leads to a huge uproar throughout the house. He usually comes back as soon as he gets hungry... usually...
#### 3
Burned in the [[boiler room|incinerator]], with a weapon resembling an [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|icepick]] sticking out of his forehead.

The old sorcerer’s wish vanished before it could be granted. He always knew that this was one possible result of his risky gamble.
## Turn

He is strongly influenced by the West and is a rabid fan of the occult.
His study is packed with mysterious grimoires.
#### 2
He finally reached the [[Golden Land]] he so desired to see.  
However, since a fool was unwilling to accept it, the magic was wasted once again.  

Even so, he was probably happy. After all, he managed to be reunited with the [[Golden Witch]], if only for a brief time.  

Afterwards, he was crushed to bits and eaten by demons and went to hell.
### Tea party
#### 1
A self-taught human sorcerer.  
His natural talent and level of knowledge are nothing special, but when his nearly insane powers of concentration and dedication were transformed into magical power, he awakened as a great sorcerer.  

His power is at least great enough that he was able to summon [[Beatrice]] and form a contract with her.  

Though his power is great, it is also extremely limited. He specializes in summoning and barriers, so perhaps it is fitting to call him a summoner.

His study is packed with mysterious grimoires.
#### 2
His body was found as a burnt corpse in the underground [[boiler room]]'s incinerator.  

No evidence of a struggle was found inside the incinerator, so it's probably reasonable to assume that he was burned after his murder.  

Too bad this time.  
It was game over right from the start.

Dust to dust. Ashes to ashes. The dead to the dead.
### Tea Party
#### 1
Goldsmith is Kinzo's sorcerer's name. His skill as a summoner is legendary for the current era. His summoning ability surpasses even [[Beatrice]]'s at times.

However, he is very mismatched, excelling in some areas while fatally lacking as a sorcerer in others.

Magic with enough power to reheat a cup of black tea may be beyond him, but he's capable of summoning demons with magic strong enough to boil the sea.

The source of his magic is found in arithmetic miracles, and his magical compendium is unique. Later on, even Beatrice took note of this and rearranged her own compendium accordingly.
