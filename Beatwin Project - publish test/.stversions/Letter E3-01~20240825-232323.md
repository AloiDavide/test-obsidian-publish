So that there will be no misunderstandings...
The game I seek is for everyone to try and solve the riddle of the epitaph, not for you to try and catch me.

If you donâ€™t solve the riddle, the pitiful sacrifices will further increase in number. It would be wiser to spend your time solving the epitaph, instead of searching for me.
If no one can solve the riddle, no one will survive.

If a person appears who can miraculously solve it, I will give them all the gold of the [[Golden Land]], the [[Ushiromiya Family]] inheritance, and all of my power.
I was the one who succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship after [[Kinzo-sama|Kinzo]]. I look forward to seeing who will succeed to that headship after me.
