# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
[[Eva]]’s husband.

He took his wife’s name upon their marriage and became a member of the Ushiromiya family. He therefore does not possess the spiteful genes passed down through Ushiromiya family members, and his bright smile is very refreshing at the family conferences.
	
He started his business from scratch and now works as the president of a medium-sized restaurant chain. This chain seems to be growing and performing extremely well.
#### 2
Found in the bathroom of the same [[eva guest room|guest room]] that [[Eva]] was found in. Like Eva, there was a weapon resembling an [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|icepick]] sticking out of his forehead.

You can’t see either of them by looking through the gap of the door while the chain is set. You can’t see them, so you can’t reach them. Hey, how could a human possibly kill them? Kihihihihihihihihihi.

His corpse was found in the [[Chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems his stomach was cut open and his intestines pulled out after his death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into his stomach.  

Why would there be anything filthy inside someone's stomach?

Died in the [[hall]] of the mansion, his chest pierced by a [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|stake-shaped weapon]].  

That was careless of me. Didn't think you were still alive......

His corpse was found in the [[dining hall]].  
About half of his head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that he was murdered with a [[powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don’t believe he was killed with a gun...
