# Descriptions

## Alliance
### 1998
#### 1
A professor at a certain college, well known as an authority on the subject of Western folklore.

He's also famous for his hobby, researching the Rokkenjima Witch Legend as one of the [[Witch Hunters]].

The primary focus of the Witch Hunt is the pasting together of occult stories to try and make them match with the Rokkenjima incident, making it much more of a mental game for dilettantes and enthusiasts of the mystical than a scientific investigation into the truth of the crime.
