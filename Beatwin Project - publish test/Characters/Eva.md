# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
[[Kinzo]]’s second child.

She is hostile towards her brother [[Krauss]] and opposes him whenever she can, from issues dealing with the family fortune to the question of who will succeed the family headship.

Normally, she would have lost her place in the Ushiromiya family register upon her marriage, but she managed to forcibly overcome this by having her husband take her family name.
#### 2
Found on the bed of a [[eva guest room|guest room]] inside the mansion, with a weapon resembling an [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|icepick]] sticking out of her forehead.

#### 2
Her corpse was found in the [[Chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems her stomach was cut open and her intestines pulled out after her death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into her stomach.  

Everyone has a stomach filled with sweet dreams.

#### 2
Her corpse was found in the [[dining hall]].  
About half of her head was destroyed. It’s probably reasonable to assume that she was murdered with a [[powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don’t believe she was killed with a gun...
### 1998
#### 1
After being repeatedly hospitalized because of psychogenic stress, she has already died in the world of 1998 due to acute heart failure.

She lived her later years in isolation, with no one to understand her, and is the only survivor from [[Rokkenjima]]. The media gave her the name “Queen of Suspicion”.

She continued to make reckless expansions of her business just like [[Kinzo]] had done in the past, which earned her many enemies.

By her later years, she was doing it merely to harass people, as if she enjoyed it, rather than for financial gain.

And it was all done for the sake of [[Ange]], who would eventually succeed her.
