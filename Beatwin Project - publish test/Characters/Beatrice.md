# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
The [[Golden Witch]], who has lived for a thousand years.

She has surpassed the limits of humans and, like demons, will sometimes appear in response to the summons made by humans, to offer her power in exchange for a price.

She likes black tea and ice cream. She hates boredom and people who deny her existence.
#### 2
What a useless dream, to try and kill me despite being a mere human. Fire your bullets, and they will merely reflect back towards you like light off a mirror.

However, there does exist just one way to kill me. You hold that method in the palm of your hand. Though I doubt one as mediocre as you could ever pull it off.

Hihihihihihihihihihihi! Heheheheheheheheheheh!

The mysterious visitor and 19th person who appeared on the day of the family conference.  
She goes by the same name as the [[Golden Witch]] who gave the gold to [[Kinzo]].  

Her reasons for visiting are unknown.  

She was ushered into the VIP room, which no one has been allowed to use in the past.

### Tea Party
### 1
The [[Endless Witch]], who has lived for a thousand years.  
She is known for being exceptionally cruel, even among witches.  

She loves bullying the weak and is capable of using trial-and-error endlessly to find the cruelest fate they can possibly be given.  
And she toys with her victims even further by piling on one after another.  

This witch is extremely powerful, but word has it that she sometimes becomes obsessed with creating certain patterns, so that her means end up becoming her goals.

The [[Endless Witch]], who has lived for a thousand years. She holds the fatherly magical power that is the source of endless evolution in the sea.

However, that power is meaningless. No matter how many times you multiply something in the sea of 0, it will never be more than 0.

However, when she was blessed by a miracle that gave birth to 1 in that sea, her world became endless.

When she was joined with the [[Witch of Origins]] through [[Mariage Sorci√®re]], their [[Magical Compendiums|magical compendium]] gained an endless span, as well as endless power.
