As the oldest of the four cousins, he acts as their leader and arbitrator.

Missing.

Even though everyone was getting along so well after being reunited in the [[Golden Land]], all of the magic came to nothing because of a certain hardheaded fool.

Afterwards, the demons chewed him to the bone, and he went to hell.

Died in [[Natsuhi]]'s room, with his stomach pierced by a weapon shaped like a stake.

His corpse was found in the [[rose garden arbor]].  
There was a single hole right in the center of his forehead. It's probably reasonable to assume he was shot with a [[gun]] or something similar.  

It’s a brand of humiliation, marking his defeat to [[Gaap]].
