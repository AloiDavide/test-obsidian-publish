# Descriptions

## Legend
### Tea Party
#### 1
The [[Witch of the Fragments]], who has lived a thousand years.

It is said she lives in a world where the concepts of fate and possibilities can be visualized. She observes the fate of humans and sometimes interferes.

In other words, sometimes she is you, and sometimes she is your only friend. ...Understand?

She likes wine and spicy foods. She hates boredom and people who never learn.
#### 2
By constantly continuing to think, I will live forever. In other words, if I were to stop thinking, I could die at any time. However, once I start thinking again, I can also revive at any time.

That’s why I’m fickle and whimsical. I live as I please, die as I please, and revive as I please.
## Turn
### Tea Party
#### 1
The [[Witch of Miracles]], who has lived for a thousand years.  
Her vast power is capable of creating all kinds of miracles, but her heart has broken a bit as a result.  

Back when she was a human, [[Lambdadelta]] once imprisoned her within a cruel fate, toying with her the whole time. As a result, it seems she’s unable to abandon others who are caught within a similar fate.  

Theoretically, she’s a witch with the greatest of powers, but in practice, this is no more realistic than folding a piece of paper a hundred times so that it reaches the moon.  

Yet, she did fold it a hundred times.

## Alliance
### Tea Party
#### 1
The [[Witch of Miracles]], who has lived for a thousand years. To defeat [[Beatrice]] in her game, she threw in a piece called [[ANGE]].

The [[Regarding Voyagers|Voyager]] witches who cross the [[sea of Fragments]] are beings far superior to the witches who cannot leave their own territories.

While they may be on an even footing inside this territory, her true magical power far surpasses that of Beatrice.

What is sought by those witches who repeatedly voyage in an attempt to escape boredom...?
