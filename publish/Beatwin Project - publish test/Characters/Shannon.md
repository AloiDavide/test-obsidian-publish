# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
A young but experienced servant.

She’s normally calm and performs her job efficiently, but she messes up when she gets nervous.

Furthermore, Shannon is nothing more than a pseudonym that she uses when on duty, not her real name.
#### 2
Her corpse was found inside the [[Rose Garden Storehouse]]. It seems the side of her head was smashed after her death.

Don’t worry. Everyone will be revived in the [[Golden Land]].
## Turn
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
A young but experienced servant.

She’s normally calm and performs her job efficiently, but she messes up when she gets nervous.

Furthermore, Shannon is nothing more than a pseudonym that she uses when on duty, not her real name.
#### 2
Died in [[Natsuhi's room]], with her forehead pierced by a weapon shaped like a stake.  

At the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.  

She spent her last moments with her beloved.
### Tea Party
#### 1
Shannon is, in the truest sense, [[Kinzo]]’s handmade furniture, which he created without borrowing the power of demons.  

Though there were a few problems with her initial specifications, she was given a very rare and precious thing: a heart.  
It seems that, as a result of his long personal experience, Kinzo came to believe that the power created by the heart contains within it a strong magic.  

In the lengthy span of time following that, she began to mature, becoming exceptionally skilled with powers of a protective or repulsive nature, such as magical barriers.  

Because of this, in the realm of barriers alone, she possesses immense, magician-class power.
## Banquet
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
A young but experienced servant.

She’s normally calm and performs her job efficiently, but she messes up when she gets nervous.

Furthermore, Shannon is nothing more than a pseudonym that she uses when on duty, not her real name.
#### 2
Her corpse was found in the [[parlor]] on the first floor.  
The weapon used on her is assumed to be a [[gun or spear-shaped object]].  

Let Shannon have the parlor, with its wonderful view of the rose garden on sunny days.
## Alliance
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
A young but experienced servant.

She’s normally calm and performs her job efficiently, but she messes up when she gets nervous.

Furthermore, Shannon is nothing more than a pseudonym that she uses when on duty, not her real name.
#### 2
Her corpse was found behind the mansion.  
About half of her head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that she was murdered with a [[powerful gun]] or something similar.  
A [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|demon stake]] had fallen near the body.  

The witnesses at least realized that the stake wasn’t what killed her. 
# Theories
