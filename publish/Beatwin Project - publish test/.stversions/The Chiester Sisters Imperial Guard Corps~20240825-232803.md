An Imperial Guard Corps formed by the Dragon King Pendragon in memory of the flight of the red dragon and composed only of sisters.

They are technically subordinates of the Dragon King, but because of a long relationship with successive generations of Beatrices, it was permitted that two Imperial Guard soldiers be lent out.

The sisters are simulated lifeforms created by magic.
For that reason, further sisters with a great variety of personalities are continually being created even now.

A great cost must be paid to manifest them in the human world, so summoning them can be quite a tricky prospect, even considering the tremendous fighting power they offer.

For that reason, they are often summoned as honor guards to serve during special ceremonies and the like.
