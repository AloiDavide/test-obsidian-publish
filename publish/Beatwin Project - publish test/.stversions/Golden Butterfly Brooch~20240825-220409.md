Golden Butterfly Brooch.

This object arranges all fate variables in a favorable manner to form relationships between the sexes.

This leads to nothing more than a favorable arrangement of variables, so its strength differs widely depending on the individuals in question.  

Hence, a witch bestowing such an item must make quite sure beforehand that the receiver will be able to use it effectively, or she risks being called a liar. The activation cost is enormous, so it’s no more useful to the average person than an ordinary brooch.  

However, blind love is easily capable of paying this enormous price. And, if the target of the receiver’s affection feels affection in turn, the brooch’s effect increases even more dramatically.  

Ironically, the more dramatic its effect becomes, the less one would need such a brooch in the first place.
