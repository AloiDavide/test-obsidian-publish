# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
[[Krauss]]’s wife.

She manages the household of the Ushiromiya head family in place of her husband, who takes little interest in such matters. She was in charge of all preparations and arrangements for this family conference.

She possesses a strong sense of responsibility and a great deal of pride.
However, neither her husband nor his siblings understand her very well, so her position is far from enviable.
#### 2
Found shot to death in front of the [[witch’s portrait]].

How impudent of her to challenge a witch with nothing but a mere [[Winchester M1984 Sawed off|gun]]. Of course, she’d end up like this. Kihihihihihihihihi.

Her corpse was found in the [[chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems her stomach was cut open and her intestines pulled out after her death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into her stomach.  

Didn't I tell you? Stomachs are packed full of candy.

#### 2
Her corpse was found in the [[rose garden arbor]].  
The cause of her death is assumed to be strangling with a [[The Chiester Golden Bows|rope-like object]]. A [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|stake-shaped weapon]] was sticking out of her calf.  

Why do I even have to follow the epitaph in the first place? Is this some kind of game?

#### 2
Her corpse was found in the [[dining hall]].  
About half of her head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that she was murdered with a [[powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don’t believe she was killed with a gun...
