# Descriptions


## Alliance
#### 1
One of the 72 Great Demons. Also [[Beatrice]]'s friend. When a magician demands it, she grants the ability of instantaneous movement.

She uses this extraordinary power for playing pranks, mostly. Her specialty is hiding keys and bags during busy mornings.

However, in the context of closed room mysteries, this power becomes an ultimate weapon that can easily strike a finishing blow. Her queen bee strikes are likely to pierce any and all detectives, forcing them to surrender.
