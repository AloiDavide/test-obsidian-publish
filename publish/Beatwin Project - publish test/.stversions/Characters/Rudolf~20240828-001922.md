# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
[[Kinzo]]’s third child.

Along with his sister, [[Eva]], he intends to make his voice heard during the family conference to prevent their oldest sibling, [[Krauss]], from keeping all of their father’s wealth for himself.

His former wife, [[Asumu]], passed away six years ago, and he married his current wife, [[Kyrie]], shortly after that.
#### 2
His corpse was found inside [[the rose garden storehouse]]. His face seems to have been smashed after death.

He has a right to lament his ill fortune.

#### 2
His corpse was found in the [[chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems his stomach was cut open and his intestines pulled out after his death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into his stomach.  

This is why we want to be as sweet and innocent as candy.
## Banquet

#### 2
Died in the [[hall]] of the mansion, with his forehead pierced by a [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|weapon shaped like a stake]].  

Apparently, they've gotta be finished off with stakes from here on out. Gross.

#### 2
His corpse was found in the [[dining hall]].  
About half of his head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that he was murdered with a [[powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don't believe he was killed with a gun...
