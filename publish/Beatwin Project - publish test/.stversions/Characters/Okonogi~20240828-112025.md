# Descriptions


## Alliance
### 1998
#### 1
A leading member of the [[Ushiromiya Group]].
Between the time of [[Eva]]’s death and Ange succeeding her position, management of the Group has fallen to core members like him in her stead.

However, [[Ange]] has no desire to inherit that role, leaving the Group on the brink of fracturing internally and putting Okonogi in a difficult position.

He was once the president of a foodstuffs distribution company and had an intimate relationship with [[Hideyoshi]]’s business.

Because of that long-lasting association, Eva trusted him particularly, and he was appointed to an important post within the Group.
