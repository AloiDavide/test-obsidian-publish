`=this.sprite`


Stakes containing the seven magics that represent the seven deadly sins. In accordance with their user’s orders, they bury themselves into the desired location of the desired target with perfect accuracy. Because they flit about at ultra-high speeds and change their trajectories at will by bouncing off walls and the like, they have no blind spots, and will hit their targets without fail no matter what form of cover they might be hiding behind. Furthermore, it is possible to change the force they hit with depending on the part of the body at which they strike.

They are extremely powerful weapons, but they cannot target pure people who have not committed one of the seven deadly sins or people who have a strong resistance to magical power.

## Banquet
### Tea Party
#### Lucifer
High-quality furniture created by [[Beatrice]].

Lucifer is the oldest of the sisters and therefore their leader.

Because of this, she claims to be the strongest of them all, but she's secretly aware that she's actually the least talented.

However, she has always acted with arrogance in an attempt to hide this fact from the others.
Her greatest fear is that her sisters will scorn her if they ever find out.
#### Leviathan
High-quality furniture created by [[Beatrice]].

Leviathan often represents the other younger sisters when speaking to Lucifer.

Deep down, she has a brutal, deeply envious nature and is adept at spotting people's weaknesses.

However, she's more of a selfish crybaby than a person burning with envy.

For some reason, she's not very good at handling tough situations, and she often ends up coming in last among the sisters, getting the short end of the stick, and crying.
#### Satan
High-quality furniture created by [[Beatrice]].

Satan takes on the role of the constantly-angry class president among the sisters.

She's always quick to scold people, which is why the other sisters are so scared of her.
For that reason, no one's ever willing to talk back to her, and she's actually quite lonely all the time.

She'll sometimes intentionally do things that ought to get her in trouble, but none of the sisters ever scold this lonely furniture back.
#### Belphegor
High-quality furniture created by [[Beatrice]].

Belphegor is well trusted and known for being a reticent, serious, and responsible piece of furniture.

However, this is partly due to her demonic desire to turn her masters into useless, lazy pigs.

In that sense, she might be the most demonic of all the sisters.

She's serious to a fault and not at all used to being treated kindly instead of the other way around.
#### Mammon
High-quality furniture created by [[Beatrice]].

Mammon is quick to grab whatever she wants, without any concern for her sisters.

Her motto is "monopolize through greed", which means she's usually the main cause of arguments between the sisters.

However, she is also the most honest about her own feelings, and the one most likely to try and please the opposite sex.

She may be greedy, but she's a hard worker who will stop at nothing to capture her target's affections for all eternity.
#### Beelzebub
High-quality furniture created by [[Beatrice]].

Beelzebub is the gourmet of the sisters and is known for being a big and picky eater.

Her personality is similar to Mammon's, and the two sisters often fight over the same thing.

She's always talking about food, which makes her a calming influence among the sisters.

However, she also has that disturbing desire to kidnap pretty boys and store them in the food cellar...
#### Asmodeus
High-quality furniture created by [[Beatrice]].

As the youngest of the sisters, Asmodeus is always doted upon.
This might be why she alone is kept out of the way whenever an even slightly lewd topic comes up.

She's always looking for a boyfriend in the hopes that her sisters will finally accept her as an adult.

However, she keeps aiming too high and whiles away each day dreaming of the prince who will never come.
