Servant Kanon

# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
A young servant.

He performs his duties silently and diligently, but is not so highly regarded as a servant due to his unsociable nature.

There are multiple other servants with the “on” (音) character in their pseudonyms. He and [[Shannon]] just happened to be the ones on duty that day.
#### 2
Found in the [[boiler room]] with a weapon resembling an [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|icepick]] sticking out of his chest.

How presumptuous of lowly furniture like that.
## Turn
### Rokkenjima
#### 1
A young servant.

He performs his duties silently and diligently, but is not so highly regarded as a servant due to his unsociable nature.

There are multiple other servants with the “on” (音) character in their pseudonyms. He and [[Shannon]] just happened to be the ones on duty that day.
#### 2
The witch erased his corpse for fun.  
That alone caused an incredible uneasiness among the survivors.  

If that which exists resides in the human world, then that which does not exist is truly fantasy.  

Fantasy takes the form of what they fear.
#### 3
There's no corpse. And yet, he's dead.  

The witch said so in [[Red Truth|red]].  
So, he definitely is dead, even though there's no corpse.
### Tea Party
#### 1
So far, he is the last furniture created by [[Kinzo]].  

Making use of all his previous experience, Kinzo managed to implement a set of flawless specs.  
Kanon was also given a heart, but it was much weaker than Shannon's.  

Perhaps because Kinzo felt a sense of approaching personal danger related to his fortune as he neared the end of his life, he bestowed Kanon with the rare power to fight and protect.  

However, he hasn’t yet matured very far and is unable to properly control his own power and speed.
## Banquet

There are multiple other servants with the “on” (音) character in their pseudonyms. He and [[Shannon]] just happened to be the ones on duty that day.
#### 2
His corpse was found in the [[Chapel]].  
The weapon used on him is assumed to be a [[gun or spear-shaped object]].  

For Kanon, the chapel. Let him continue to protect the Lord's precious place, even after death.

#### 2
Battler was not able to find his corpse.  

No matter how he’s killed with magic, without a corpse, he’s a definite suspect.  
Now that’s definitely anti-fantasy.  

<font color="#ff0000">Therefore, I guarantee his death with the red truth.  </font>

Now that’s definitely anti-mystery...!
