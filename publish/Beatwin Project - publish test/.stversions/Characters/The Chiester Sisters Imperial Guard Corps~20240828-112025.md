	An Imperial Guard Corps formed by the Dragon King Pendragon in memory of the flight of the red dragon and composed only of sisters.

They are technically subordinates of the Dragon King, but because of a long relationship with successive generations of [[Beatrice|Beatrices]], it was permitted that two Imperial Guard soldiers be lent out.

The sisters are simulated lifeforms created by magic.
For that reason, further sisters with a great variety of personalities are continually being created even now.

A great cost must be paid to manifest them in the human world, so summoning them can be quite a tricky prospect, even considering the tremendous fighting power they offer.

For that reason, they are often summoned as honor guards to serve during special ceremonies and the like.

# Descriptions
## Banquet
### Tea Party
#### Chiester 45
A weapon in a contract with [[Beatrice]].

45 has a methodical and timid personality, as well as a fairly strong persecution complex.
Thanks to that, she's well suited to shoring up the weaknesses of 410's rough personality when they work as a pair.

She can't stand silence, so she'll often become emotionally insecure if she isn't being ordered around by someone constantly.

45 excels in search and decision-making capabilities. The support she provides doubles the combative force of the sisters
#### Chiester 410
A weapon in a contract with [[Beatrice]].

410 is a kid with a strong personality, whose peculiar style of speech tends to make light of people.
She likes laughing at people who are serious or can never relax, which is why she's so fond of 45 and [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|Lucifer]].

Her choice of words may be coarse, but she loves company and gets lonely easily.
She gets depressed if there isn't someone talking with her constantly.

410 is particularly skilled when it comes to firing control, and she can wield unparalleled combative force even in close-range fighting.
