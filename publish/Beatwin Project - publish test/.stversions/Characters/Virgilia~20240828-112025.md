# Descriptions
## Banquet
### Tea Party
#### 1
A now-retired [[Endless Witch]] and [[Beatrice]]'s teacher.

She used the Endless Magic properly and devoted her life to the smiles and happiness of many people.

She taught Beatrice the Endless Magic, believing that Beatrice would also devote herself to the people, and retired.

Though she was Beatrice's teacher, she was also a magician employed by Beatrice's family.
For that reason, she interacted with Beatrice in a manner fitting for a servant.
Some point to this as the source of Beatrice's arrogance and recklessness.
