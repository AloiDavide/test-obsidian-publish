His corpse was found in the [[rose garden arbor]].  
The cause of his death is assumed to be strangling with a [[The Chiester Golden Bows|rope-like object]]. A [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|stake-shaped weapon]] was sticking out of his thigh.  

If only there wasn't that stupid epitaph, I wouldn't have needed a stake. What a pain.

His corpse was found in a guest room deep within the mansion.  
About half of his head was destroyed. Itâ€™s probably reasonable to assume that he was murdered with a powerful gun or something similar.  

A [[The Seven Stakes of Purgatory|demon stake]] was buried into the damaged area.  

No one can escape from [[The Chiester Golden Bows|the Chiester's golden arrows]].
