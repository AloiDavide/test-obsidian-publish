[[Nanjo]]'s son. Inherited the [[Nanjo Clinic]].
Unlike Nanjo, he seems to be a more sobered, indifferent person.

After the rampage surrounding [[Rokkenjima]], he grew to completely despise the press, and he never spoke again of what happened around that time.

He once had a daughter afflicted with an incurable disease, but unfortunately, she wasn't able to live out her natural lifespan.
