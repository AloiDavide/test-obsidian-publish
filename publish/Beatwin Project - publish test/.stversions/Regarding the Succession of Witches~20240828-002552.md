In the noble families of witches, family secrets are often inherited by a single child to prevent a propagation of hidden arts and a subsequent decline in their quality.

This rule applies for the Endless Witches, so their most secret arts are passed down to a single pupil, and once one has passed down these arts to another, they retire to further stem their propagation.

Custom dictates that a witch from another sect make a recommendation before a succession may occur.

[[Lambdadelta]] recommended [[EVA|EVA Beatrice]]. Bernkastel recommended [[ANGE|Ange Ushiromiya]]. It is unknown who recommended [[Beato]].

Furthermore, during the story, Beatrice inherited that name along with the position, but that is a very recent innovation. The Predecessor was the original Beatrice, and all Endless Witches before her had different names. After that, it became customary for the name to be inherited as well, and EVA followed that tradition when giving ANGE the name of Beatrice.
