# Descriptions

## Alliance
### 1998
#### 1
[[Maria|Maria onee-chan]]’s precious friend.
Very simple, warm and kind.

Tends to say “Uryuu”.

Didn’t Maria onee-chan also have a habit of saying this, long ago?
### Tea Party
#### 1
The beloved furniture of [[Maria|Lady MARIA]], a witch of [[Mariage Sorcière]].

He is Lady MARIA's white heart itself. You might even say he's a second Lady MARIA and irreplaceable to her.

He holds a decoration as a diplomat, and none may attack him, not any of the witches, weapons, and furniture in the alliance, nor any of the demons and divine spirits in a contract with the alliance.
#### 2
[[Maria|Lady MARIA]]'s white heart, which was torn apart.

His broken vessel can only be regenerated by the Meister who created him, [[Rosa|ROSA]].

However, ROSA disposed of the vessel's fragments and even lost the pattern paper. On top of that, his existence was denied by the Meister herself, so his resurrection is now impossible.

The Meister died in [[1986]], and any chance for his resurrection disappeared for all time.

Even the [[Endless Witch]], [[Beatrice]], could not manage it......

Sakutaro è la parte positiva di [[Maria]], muore quando Rosa lo rompe.
Alla fine viene resuscitato da [[Ange]] convincendo Maria che ciò è possibile.
Maria e [[Beatrice]] non erano al corrente dell'esistenza del secondo peluche, dunque non gli era possibile ricrearlo.
