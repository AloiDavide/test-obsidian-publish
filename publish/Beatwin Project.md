SCIENCE compels us to TEST THE LIMITS of the narrative of the [[Beatrice|GOLDEN WITCH BEATRICE]].

[[Battler|Ushiromiya Battler]] has revealed himself to be COMPLETELLY INCOMPETENT and INADEQUATE TO THE TASK of DEFEATING THE GOLDEN WITCH BEATRICE at her own game. This is NOTHING SHORT OF UNACCEPTABLE! We are going to create a theory UNDEFEATABLE to slay the GOLDEN WITCH and defeat her narrative. We will SUCCEED where Icarus has FAILED.
