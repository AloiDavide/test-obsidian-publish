A sawed-off custom version of a rifle manufactured during the golden age of Winchesters.
This special model more than makes up for its shorter lethal range by its portability and old-time cool factor. It can even be fired as quickly as a pistol if one works the lever action skillfully enough. Furthermore, any true lover of old western dramas can't help but be attracted to the one-handed reload made possible by its characteristic lever handle.

To match with [[Kinzo|Ushiromiya Kinzo]]'s personal preferences, it was made to handle .45 Long Colt bullets.
It holds 4+1 rounds.
